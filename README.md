# Restaurant Orders Management

This is an early training project developed in **Java** with **OOP principles**.  
The user interface is built using **Swing**, and the project manages data using **files** (no database is used).  

## Project Overview
- **Language:** Java  
- **Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- **Data Storage:** Files for storing orders and related data  
- **UI:** Swing-based graphical interfaces  
- **Team:** Developed by me and two teammates  

## Purpose
⚠️ This project is part of my **learning journey**.  
It contains some **intentional/training errors** as it was my **first attempt** at building a project like this.  

I decided to keep it as a **reference of my learning progress**, to reflect my early experiences and development as a programmer.

## Notes
- This project is not fully polished, but it demonstrates **basic OOP concepts and file handling in Java**.
